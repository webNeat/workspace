# Workspace

## Goals

- Separate environments (PHP, NodeJS, Qt, ...) using VMs (Vagrant boxes).

- Ability to have VMs with GUI.

- Shared dot-files and setup files between VMs.

- All VMs share the same projects folder.

- Easy way to modify dot-files or setup scripts and apply changes to VMs.

- Easy way to create new VM.

- Easy way to restore the whole workspace (after format for example).
